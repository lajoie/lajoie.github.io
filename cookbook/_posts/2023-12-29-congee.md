## Ingredients
- 1 cup rice
- 8 cups water

## Preperations
Combine and boil until consistency close to pudding

## Notes
- I'll sub half the water for [/cookbook/dashima-broth/].
- I usually top with a pork sausage that I've cooked until very crisp and some them chili oil/crisp
- Other toppings I use sometimes: kimchi, soy-pickled diakon, shredded chicken (usually with chili oil)
