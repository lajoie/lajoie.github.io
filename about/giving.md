*For future readers - I am writing this at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022...*

For the first part of my professional life I worked in higher education and research.  I wasn't personally curing different types of cancers or finding proof of fundamental forces in physics but I was helping others do these things and believed that over the long run the basic research I helped support would be a net good.  However, I also wanted some things from life that I just wasn't going to get on a single person's, higher ed tech-jockey job which, at the time, paid 30-50% below private sector rates.  After about a decade of doing that, I decided to move into the private sector.  At the time, I knew I was making a selfish choice to trade off "doing some good" with "getting some things I wanted".

Well, now it's been about another decade.  Over these 10 years my private sector work has let me get the items I wanted, including, and finally, this old, beautiful house I have now.  The decade has also given me time to get my own inner demons mostly under control.  After having left my job at Domino's in November, I've taken a good chunk of time to figure out what I want to do next.  As part of that, I am finding that I really, really miss the "doing good" part of my life.  So, I've been thinking on how to effectively do the most good I can and, it turns out, this has been a relatively hot topic recently.
